People say they want privacy until they meet someone who actually has it. Not the performative “private” where you still post soft launches, vague captions, story replies, little curated hints so everyone can keep tracking the plot. I mean real privacy. The kind where your life doesn’t come with commentary. Where your phone isn’t a public window. Where your wins, your losses, your relationships, your breakdowns don’t get uploaded as evidence. people get weird. You can see the moment their brain hits the wall. They ask a normal question, “so what have you been up to,” and you give them a normal answer that is also a closed door. “Work’s been busy.” “Just been chilling.” “Nothing crazy.” You smile. You move on. And something in them doesn’t relax. Because they weren’t asking for facts. They were asking for access. A lot of people are not used to not having access. We live in a time where everyone is constantly narrating themselves. Posting their meals, their heartbreak, their therapy language, their gym progress, their new person, their new home, their new era. Even if they say “I’m private,” they still leak. They drop breadcrumbs on purpose because being fully unseen feels like death to them. So when you don’t leak, they start filling the silence with stories. They assume you’re hiding something. They assume you’re lying. They assume you think you’re better than them. They assume you’re judging them. They assume you’re mysterious in a calculated way, like you’re playing chess while they’re making small talk. Sometimes they even get offended, which is hilarious. Like your privacy is an insult. Like you owe them transparency to prove you’re “real.” Like you owe the room a plotline so they can orient themselves. And if you don’t give it, they start poking. Testing. Fishing. “So are you seeing anyone?” “What happened with that job?” “Why don’t you post more?” “Where were you last weekend?” “Who were you with?” They try to catch you. Not because they care. Because they’re unsettled by not being able to map you. This is the part no one says out loud: a lot of people use information as control. Not evil control. Everyday control. Social control. The kind where if I know what you’re doing, I know where I stand. If I know your relationship status, I know how to treat you. If I know your problems, I know what role to play in your life. If I know your weaknesses, I know how to win an argument later. If I know your plans, I know if you’re leaving me behind. So when you’re truly private, you remove a tool they rely on. u become unpredictable in a way that scares them, because they can’t pre-empt you. They can’t manage you. They can’t keep a running tally of your life and compare it to theirs. They can’t decide if they should envy you, pity you, compete with you, flirt with you, ignore you. They have to relate to you in real time, on what you actually say and do, not on the story they’ve been consuming from your feed. that is rare now. It’s also intimate in a way people don’t expect. Because if you don’t broadcast, then the only way to know you is to know you. To ask. To listen. To spend time. To earn the details. To be trusted. Most people don’t have the patience for that. They want the summary. The highlights. The quick scroll that tells them what category you’re in. So they get odd. They start guessing. They’ll call you “mysterious” like it’s either a compliment or a warning. They’ll joke that you’re “secretive” when what they mean is “I can’t track you.” They’ll project motives onto you. They’ll decide you’re arrogant. Or traumatized. Or sneaky. Or having an amazing life and hiding it. Or having a miserable life and hiding it. They’ll pick a narrative and treat it like fact because uncertainty makes them itch. And sometimes - this is the sharp one - they’ll try to provoke you into revealing yourself. They’ll say something slightly disrespectful just to see if you react.

They’ll push boundaries. They’ll ask invasive questions in front of other people so it’s harder for you to dodge without looking “rude.” They’ll bait you with gossip and see if you bite. Anything to get a read. Because to them, your privacy feels like a locked room in a house they assumed they had full access to. The funny thing is, real private people are usually not trying to be interesting at all. You’re not building intrigue. You’re just living. You’re not hiding a “secret life.” You just don’t want your life to be a public performance. You don’t want your happiness to be picked at. You don’t want your pain to be consumed. You don’t want your relationships to be discussed by people who can’t hold them with care. And that’s the part that quietly makes you powerful. Not in a fake “mystique” way. In a grounded way. Because when you don’t give everyone the keys to your inner world, you stop bleeding attention. You stop spending energy managing how you’re perceived. You stop living for reactions. You move through rooms lighter. You choose who gets the real you. You protect the soft parts. And yes, it makes some people act strange. Because a lot of them have built their entire social reality on mutual access. I show you mine, you show me yours. We trade vulnerability like currency. We trade updates like proof we still matter to each other. When you opt out of that economy, they don’t know what to do with you. The right people won’t punish you for it. They’ll adjust. They’ll get curious in a respectful way. They’ll let silence exist without turning it into suspicion. They’ll understand that privacy is not deception. It’s discernment. The wrong people will spiral. They’ll try to crack you. They’ll make up stories. They’ll get resentful. Let them. A person who needs access to feel okay was never going to feel safe to you anyway.
