## Introduction
*"A True beauty of Pastel-coloured Environment"*
Note XIV ~ Morale Whimsical Aneka

Note XIV is a fifteen installment of 'Note' Series created by Excel 'Cel' Koushiroue 
in Mid-2017. It was the first Note Series to distributed in digital-environment suitable for Workstation, PCs and laptop in contrast to Note Neutrii's failure in mobile counterpart.

The Note XIV uses Sublime as its base for all documentaries. Some of the parts from 
Note Neutrii has been poorly ported over and currently undergoing maintenance.
Whlie most of the Note Series is derive into three subcategory such as Info, Art and Games, Note XIV tends to focus on mostly Documentaries.
Because of limitless in digital format, Note XIV does not have a front-end to replicate such interface reminisce the previous Note series.
As of August 2018, Note XIV change it's base to using Microsoft Visual Studio Code
Community Edition.
It's is also considered in using "Geany" IDE for flexibility.

The Successor of Note XIV is announced in Late-2018 under the name "Note XV", with Note Neutrii replacement being worked on.
## Development 
The Failure of Note Neutrii has influencing of a replacement in another digital platform.
This because evolving to digital from physical isn't a common task. A recreation of 
'finger-tapping' for virtual keyboard in Note Neutrii interface inappopriately apply to
each other. This resolves to moving in another platform that doesn't simulate keyboard but rather natively.
Note XIV is still new in grasping digital convenience, therefore there is no graphical
user interface. All changes , Addition and Modification was made using external tools such as Sublime Text.
In CEL's decision in moving to a digital platform, there are benefits of being in the digital rather than physical :
 - Format is not limited to text and freeform graphics.
 - There is no page limitation; the only limitation is main storage space where Note XIV is saved to, (Unless a cloud storage is considered(which does not solve the storage problem economically)).
 - For Note XIV, in this case, the productivity is increased depends of hardware capability.
It lacks the obvious feature from having the physical media : 
- The Physical representation of Note XIV is inside the storage medium and requires cost-sensitive hardware to even view its content. (This was later tuned down with the use of portable electronics).
- Not easily accessible in the terms of portability. (again, the portable media play a huge role in tuning this down).
- Inorganic; cannot determine the exact originality of the content that will lead to consistency issues.
Note XIV may implement "Cloud Storage" in the future.
By utilizing Standard XAMPP WebServer, it is possible to create a 'online' version of
Note series.
